              <h2>About me in short</h2>
              <p>So my name is Yannick, I'm a student of the Metis Montessori high school, where I learn most of my programming knowledge.
              With that I've made many small and simple <a href="projecten.html">projects</a>, and I'm proudest of the ones which are small games. I've used languages such as, 
              Python, Javascript, C# and a little bit of Java.
              At the moment I'm using the Unity game engine the most, but since my laptop is terrible, progress on Unity games is slow.
              Luckily, I have other hobbies to do while we wait for Unity to load.</p>

              <h2>My hobbies</h2>
              <p>Well, for one, I play quite a lot of video games, mostly on my computer. What's more interesting is the games I make myself. But that isn't what this paragraph is about. 
                What is interesting, however, is my other hobby, bouldering.
              </p>
              <p>Bouldering is a sport in which you climb up a small wall (circa 3m) via a route of a certain colour, without a rope. 
                You only use climbing shoes and a little bit of chalkpowder most of the time. There are many grades in bouldering, and everybody has
                their own projects which they work on trying to beat. Beating a route is climbing to the top and gripping the marked hold with both hands (for at least 3s).
                There are many tricky ways to get up the wall, and there's always a harder newer route for you to try and climb. That way there's always something to do!
                <br>
                I've even made my own blog about about bouldering, altough it is in Dutch, as I made it for school. Anyway, you can find that blog down below.
